# Algorithms

This repository contains important CS algorithms, analysis and simplified code fragments.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

BFS is an algorithm for tree and graph traversal. The algorithm starts at an arbitrary node and explores neighbours, level by level.

## Depth-First serach (DFS)

DFS is also an algorithm for tree and graph traversal. The algorithm differs from BFS as it explores to the bottom of each branch and then backtracks to explore the nodes

## Analysis

There is a file included on probabilistic analysis and randomized algorithms that explore the Hiring Problem (Secretary Problem) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_problem
